# **Misfunk** - ***Miscellaneous R functions***

### Misfunk is a container of R functions that I developed during the years that helped me to tidy, analyze, and plot a variety of data types but especially microbiome-related and community ecology data. I think one of the most iportant functions of research is to make other research to be easily build upon so we can grow a better, hopefully more solid, understanding of what we are studying. This package is far to be complete (... I just started) and it will grow and grow and many more functions will be added ...
